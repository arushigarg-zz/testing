Document Conversion : convert to any format


Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.

Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.

list.extend(seq)
Appends the contents of seq to list
To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a comma, even though there is only one value

Any set of multiple objects, comma-separated, written without identifying symbols, i.e.,brackets for lists,
 parentheses for tuples, etc., default to tuples, as indicated in these short examples −
print 'abc', -4.24e93, 18+6.6j, 'xyz'
x, y = 1, 2;
print "Value of x , y : ", x,y

Every Python class keeps following built-in attributes and they can be accessed using dot operator like any other attribute −

__dict__: Dictionary containing the class's namespace.

__doc__: Class documentation string or none, if undefined.

__name__: Class name.

__module__: Module name in which the class is defined. This attribute is "__main__" in interactive mode.

__bases__: A possibly empty tuple containing the base classes, in the order of their occurrence in the base class list.

Python protects those members by internally changing the name to include the class name. 
You can access such attributes as object._className__attrName
