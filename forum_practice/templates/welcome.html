<p>A function point count has many uses. 
•	Function Points can be used to communicate more effectively with business user groups.
•	Function Points can be used to reduce overtime.
•	Function points can be used to establish an inventory of all transactions and files of a current project or application.  This inventory can be used as a means of financial evaluation of an application.  If an inventory is conducted for a development project or enhancement project, then this same inventory could be used to help maintain scope creep and to help control project growth.  Even more important this inventory helps understand the magnitude of the problem.
•	Function Points can be used to size software applications.  Sizing is an important component in determining productivity (outputs/inputs), predicting effort, understanding unit cost, so on and so forth.
